# VMX Codec

VMX is video codec designed for very high encoding/decoding performance in software.
VMX began as the "vMix Video Codec" used for the vMix Instant Replay feature.
It has since been expanded with alpha channel support and incorporated into the Open Media Transport protocol.

## Features
* Low latency intra-frame only
* 4:2:2:4 with alpha channel support
* Highly optimized AVX2 code capable of encoding 2160p60 on a single Intel i7 core
* Cross platform. (Windows, Mac, Linux) with ARM NEON support provided via sse2neon

## Getting Started

Binaries with Library files are available for most major platforms and are the recommended way to get started.

### C/C++
Include vmxcodec.h, reference libvmx.lib and you're ready to go.

### C#/VB.Net
All functions can be called with DllImport

Use IntPtr for instance. No structs need to be defined.

## Compiling

### Windows

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 and Intel C++ Compiler 2024 or higher
2. Open libvmx.sln
3. Build

### Linux

1. Install Clang
2. cd ./build
3. Run ./buildlinuxx86.sh or ./buildlinuxarm64.sh depending on platform

### Mac (ARM64)

1. Install xcode with Apple Clang Compiler
2. cd ./build
3. Run ./buildmacarm64.sh
